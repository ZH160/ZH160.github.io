## Disconnect is a bad idea during traing

One thing I learned from the pain is that do not disconnect when the code is running. Even it is caused by inactivity.

I have lost the image of 10 classes of animals for 3 times and each time took about half an hour to search. This run out the GPU access time.

Thus, the learning without GPT took about 55 minutes. And the the checking part even gave the probility of the image could be a bird image as 0.001.

And it seem inpractical to repert the tuning again.

So, only leave the significant part to GPU. Otherwise a painful and dougthful learning process would pop-up.
